Place the Python file (NamesSorter.py) in the same directory as the data you want to sort, which should
be contained in a file called 'Sort Me.txt'.

The script will ask you whether you want to sort the data in reverse or not. Enter "yes" or "no" to indicate your choice.

The Python script will read the data from 'Sort Me.txt' and output the sorted content to the console.

--- Setup ---
Place the Python files in the same directory as the data you want to sort, which should
be contained in a file called 'Sort Me.txt'. The test data should also be in this directory.

--- Running the Script ---
Run the script in the shell using the command
python3 NamesSorter.py

If you wish to sort the data in reverse, instead run the command
python3 NamesSorter.py -r

In either case, the output will be recorded in Output.txt

--- Testing ---
To test the program, put your presorted output in "Sorted Text.txt" and reversed sorted text in "Sorted Text - Reversed.txt".
Then run the command
python3 Tester.py

The Test script will test the output from both forwards and reverse sorting, and report any discrepancies to the console.
